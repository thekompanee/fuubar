Fuubar is an instafailing "RSpec":https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec formatter that uses a progress bar instead of a string of letters and dots as feedback. Here's "a video of Fuubar in action":http://vimeo.com/16845253.

You're on the legacy branch that supports RSpec ~> 1.3 right now. There's an "RSpec 2.x branch":https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/fuubar too. :)

h2. Installation

Installing Fuubar is easy. Just put it in your @Gemfile@:

bc. gem 'fuubar', :git => 'git://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/fuubar.git', :branch => 'legacy'

And run your specs like this from now on:

bc. $ spec --format Fuubar --color spec

If you want to use Fuubar as your default formatter, simply put the options in your @spec/spec.opts@ file:
